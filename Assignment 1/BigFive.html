<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>Neuroticism - 48 (Low)<br>Extroversion - 82 (High)<br>Openness to Experience - 97(High)<br>Agreeableness - 106 (High)<br>Conscientiousness - 98 (High)</h4>
<p>
The results of the Big Five personality test show that I have a high level of confidence in my abilities and a drive to achieve my goals.  I am dependable and organised, which helps me to work effectively towards the ambitious standards I set for myself.  In the context of this personality test, extroversion demonstrates a desire to engage with the world, and an ability to put forward ideas and work with others.  I have a desire to get on well with others, and an ability to see things from other peopleâ€™s perspectives.  My high level of openness to experience shows an ability to come up with imaginative solutions, and reflects on my comfort in being flexible over the course of a project.  If an idea is not panning out, I am happy to let it go and try another solution.  I agree with the low neuroticism score, which refers to my optimistic and positive outlook.
</p>
<h3>Effects Within A Team</h3>
<p>
In a team environment, I tend to be hard working and confident in my abilities.  I can express my ideas to the group and argue my point, but I am also open to different perspectives.   Whilst I appreciate constructive criticism and I am good at working together with others I do much better work in a collaborative team than a competitive environment.  My strengths lie in working with others to achieve a common goal, as opposed to competing against others to come up with something better than them.  This is something that has been reflected in this personality test, with a relatively high level of self consciousness reported.
</p>
<h3>Team Formation</h3>
<p>
In forming a team, the results of this test reflect the Myers-Briggs test closely.  Clearly defined roles within a team will allow me to work at my best, with everyone able to work on their own area of responsibility and a fair distribution of work.  I also value regular and open communication, so establishing regular meetings and other forms of communication are important.  A collaborative team of like minded people would be advantageous as everyone should be willing to work hard on their own area, whilst giving honest and helpful feedback to others.
