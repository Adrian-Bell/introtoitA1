<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
The Myers-Briggs test results indicated my personality type to be a person with strong principles, who wants to see the best outcomes for others.  I stand up for what is right and aim to use my skills for the greater good.  I work hard to do my best in the areas I am passionate about, finding creative solutions and looking beyond appearances to get to the heart of the matter.  The results also indicate that I am something of a perfectionist and can be sensitive to criticism, particularly when the criticism does not align with my core values.  At times I can be reluctant to ask for help, preferring to work through problems by myself.  Because I tend to work hard and focus on a task, I need to take time to recharge and look after myself.  This is something I have found to be important in my life and I enjoy time spent outdoors with family or alone, away from the stresses of everyday life.
</p>
<h3>Effects Within A Team</h3>
<p>
Because I have a strong work ethic and strive to find an ideal solution, I feel that I am an asset in a team environment.  In leadership roles I try to motivate others to do their best, preferring to encourage their best efforts rather than criticise their shortcomings or ‘crack the whip.’  In a more subordinate position I work hard on the tasks I am responsible for and try to produce my best work for the good of the team.  I am comfortable in either role and do not feel a particular need to be the boss if there are others in the team who are better suited to this position.  If a team is not open and collaborative, I can become very focused on my own responsibilities, and I need to remember look at the big picture.  I try to maintain regular and open communication with other team members to mitigate this.
</p>
<h3>Team Formation</h3>
<p>
I work best in a mutually supportive environment and value open communication, so in forming a team I would look for other people who share this attitude.  It is my hope that this would lead to a more collaborative environment, rather than a competitive one.  Because of my strong principles I work best with like-minded people who can give constructive criticism and work together to find the best outcome.  Defining roles within the team is an important consideration, especially because I take my responsibility seriously.  I will focus on my own task within the team and having well defined roles helps prevent some people taking on too much, or even overstepping into other team member’s roles.
