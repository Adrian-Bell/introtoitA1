<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
I intend to develop a weather station using a raspberry pi and create an app to view and interpret the information gathered.  Weather data will be collected using several sensors, and the raspberry pi will be configured as a web server to allow the app access to this data.  The weather station will use a solar / battery power supply and connect to the internet using Wi-Fi.
</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Weather is something that affects our lives in many ways and weather data may be useful for a number of different reasons such as horticulture or project planning.  Downloads of the top weather apps in Australia are in excess of one million users, and there are a number of community-based weather observation groups both online and “in real life”.
</p>
<p>
Weather can vary widely depending on location, with localised readings being potentially quite different over a separation of only a few kilometers.  Information for specific locations is, therefore, unique and only available if there is a reliable weather station at the location.
</p>
<h2>Desription</h2>
<p>
The project has two major components – the weather station itself, and the website to interpret and view the data.
</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Weather Station</h3></li>
<p>
The weather station will use a number of sensors to measure temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure and rainfall.  These sensors will be connected to GPIO pins on the raspberry pi, and the raspberry pi will run programs to interpret the inputs and generate useful data.  It will be set up to act as a web server to upload this data to a database so that it can be interpreted and displayed by the website.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Sensors</h4></li>
  <p>
    Two commercially available combination sensor units will be required
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pressure, Temperature and Humidity Sensor</li>
      <p>
      This is a passive electronic sensor, which will be connected to GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi
      </p>
      <li>Anemometer, Wind Vane and Rainfall Gauge</li>
      <p>
        These are active mechanical sensors, and they will also be connected to GPIO pins, with the need for some extra circuitry to be used.  Initially this can be done with a breadboard for prototyping, with a printed circuit board to be used in the final product.
      </p>
      <p>
        The anemometer is made to spin by the wind, and on each revolution a reed switch is triggered.  From this, it is possible to determine the average wind speed over a given time (say, a few minutes).  Wind gusts can also be measured by taking the maximum reading over a couple of seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wind vane consists of a rotating magnet and a circular arrangement of reed switches and resistors of varying capacities. The wind vane will rotate depending on the wind direction, and the magnet will trigger particular reed switches to open or close, which changes the resistance and therefore the output voltage.  As the raspberry pi can only read a digital input (high or low voltage) the analog data from the wind vane must be converted to digital by using an analog to digital convertor.  This component is available as a 16 pin DIL chip (MCP3008) which can be incorporated into the breadboard and PCB.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rainfall gauge consists of a small bucket which fills with water to a set level.  Once this level is reached, the bucket tips, which triggers a switch and empties the bucket.  The number of times the switch is triggered determines the amount of rainfall in a predetermined time period.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <li><h4>Interpretation of Data</h4></li>
    <p>
      Several programs will need to be written in Python to interpret the input from the sensors.  The details of each will vary depending on the parameter being measured, but the intent for each will be to take an average reading over a set time period and record the data in a database.  The weather station will be connected to Wi-Fi as a way to transfer this data to the remote database.
    </p>
    <li><h4>Power Source</h4></li>
    <p>
      For the purposes of prototyping, it may be necessary to use a mains power adapter to power the project, although in its final form it should be possible to use solar panels and a battery to supply the required power.
    </p>
  </ul>
<li><h3>Website</h3></li>
<p>
The weather station will use python programs to record measurements to an SQL database.  This will be accessed by the website by using PHP and data will be displayed in an HTML table.  Data will be presented in an easy to interpret form, and it will be possible to access the data remotely.  Further to the table of data, it should be possible to create graphs of historical observations etc.
</p>
</ul>
<h2>Tools and Tech</h2>
<p>
The project will require a considerable number of materials, and a diverse range of skills.  The hardware should be easy to source, as all sensors, components and the raspberry pi itself are commonly available products.  Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 would provide the simplest way of connecting to wi-fi and allow simple connection of all additional hardware.  General fabrication and prototyping tools and materials will also be required such as a breadboard, wire, soldering equipment etc.
</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>
Most of the programming skills required for the project will be in Python, with a certain amount of HTML needed for the website.  Fabrication of the project will require skills and knowledge relating to electronics and circuit design.  It should be possible to develop the required skills, providing a basic level of knowledge is already present.  Overall, the project is very feasible to develop and build to a working prototype stage in the timeframe given.
</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
The project will allow the easy monitoring of current and historical weather data.  The information will be available remotely and could be tailored to provide more information on a particular aspect of the weather (for example using shorter time periods for measurements).  Including additional sensors could also allow further information to be gathered.  The information may be required for use in certain industries, or it could simply be to satisfy personal curiosity.
</p>
<p>
On completion, the weather station will provide a standalone product to monitor the weather, with integration into a custom designed website.
