<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
I intend to develop a website which allows community service organisations (Providers) to create a profile page showcasing what services they can provide.  The information will be stored in a database and can be accessed by people seeking services in the local area (Users).
</p>
<p>
The profile page created by the provider will have a standardized layout, and will be populated with information they enter into an HTML form when they set up their profile.
</p>
<p>
Users will be able to search the database by service type and location to find and contact providers relevant to them.
</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
I have worked in an aged and disability care provider for several years, and regularly see vulnerable people who are not aware of the help that is available to them.  Even within a small community there are services provided under several local, state and federal government programs by a diverse array of providers.  The process of finding help and registering for assistance can be overwhelming, and often the biggest hurdle is the first step of finding the right organization to talk to.
</p>
<p>
I hope that collating the details of the various organisations in one place will significantly simplify the process of finding help for vulnerable people who might otherwise fall through the cracks
</p>

<h2>Desription</h2>
<p>
The main function of the website is to link service providers to those seeking services.  The homepage of the site will ask which category visitors fall into – Service Providers or Service Seekers - and direct them to the appropriate area on the site.
</p>
<h3>Service Providers</h3>
<p>
  Service providers will be directed to a page with an HTML form which will be used to collect data about the organization and the services they provide.  The information requested will be largely standardized to allow a consistent and reliable profile page to be generated for each provider.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of data to be collected
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>Organisation Name / Logo / Cover Photo</li>
  <br><li>Services Offered – Selected from a list for consistency, as these will be the main keywords used for search queries. It may be necessary to allow additional services to be typed in manually to allow a more comprehensive list</li>
  <br><li>Postcode / Suburb of areas where the services are delivered.  Again, this list will need to be consistent to allow accurate matching of search queries.</li>
  <br><li>Hours of Operation</li>
  <br><li>Background information on the organization – limited to a couple of paragraphs</li>
  <br><li>Contact Details</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
This information will be sent by HTTP POST to a PHP file for processing.  It will be stored in a Relational Database Management Service (RDBMS) such as MySQL or MariaDB.
  </p>
<h3>Service Seekers</h3>
<p>
Service seekers will be directed to a page which either allows them to search directly for services by organization name, service type or location, or gives the option of entering some information about themselves and the areas they might need help with.  This information can then be used to suggest services that may be of benefit.
</p>
<p>
The search information will be entered into an HTML form, then sent to another PHP file which will search the database for relevant entries.  When matching entries are found, the data provided by the service provider will be used to populate an HTML template and generate the profile page for the organization.
</p>
<p>
These organization profile pages are what will be returned to the user, who will then be able to contact the provider either using the contact details provided or using a contact form included in the site.
</p>
<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<p>
Other considerations that need to be addressed are the ability to edit organization data once it has been entered.  This should be a relatively straightforward function to add, using a similar method to the initial data entry form process.
</p>
<p>
Two important considerations for service seekers are ease of use and anonymity.  Many of those in need of help may have limited experience with computer use, lack of IT resourses or other barriers to engaging with overly complicated systems.  The search function should, therefore, be cross platform, intuitive and user friendly.  Anonymity is often important to vulnerable people, who might not want to register an account, for example, because of their personal situation.  For this reason users should not be required to enter contact details or register an account.
</p>
<p>
Accuracy of data in a site with largely user generated content will be an issue that needs attention.  The use of lists to choose data such as location, service type etc will help in these areas, as will email verification for contact details. Fields requiring text input will be difficult to monitor for accuracy, and consideration will also need to be given to security.  A review feature might go some way to improve accuracy of information provided, and a fixed duration for listings would help to get rid of listings which are no longer relevant or accurate.
</p>




<h2>Tools and Tech</h2>

<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p>
The user interface will be comprised of pages written largely in HTML/CSS, so no additional specific software or hardware should be required.  The user generated input will be sent by HTTP POST, processed by PHP and returned to populate a HTML template, which will comprise the organization profile.
</p>
<h3>Server / Database</h3>
<p>
Server / database requirements will be met by the use of XAMPP.  “XAMPP is a completely free, easy to install Apache distribution containing MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. The XAMPP open source package has been set up to be incredibly easy to install and to use.” (VMware 2022)
</p>
<p>
This will comprise the majority of the software required to make the project work, with additional technologies and and resourses potentially being discovered over the course of development.
</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>
The user interface will require knowledge of HTML/CSS and an ability to integrate all elements into one site.
</p>
<p>
The storage and retrieval of data will require a knowledge of PHP, SQL and RDBMS.  Various online resourses are available to gain knowledge in the required areas (Refsnes Data 2022, Wikipedia, 2021) and from my initial research, it seems feasible for a group to acquire the skills necessary to complete a working model of the website within the timeframe provided.
</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
If the project is successful, the website will provide a service which matches people’s needs with services that are on offer.  Service providers will benefit from the exposure to potential clients, while people in need of services will benefit by being put in touch with organisations that can help them.
</p>
<p>
The website will provide a centralized location to advertise a diverse range of organisations and services that can be hard to track down.  Often it is the first step of finding the service that is needed that can be the stumbling block which stops people from finding help.  A simple and accessible website that makes it easier to find this information will be of great benefit to people in need.
