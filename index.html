<h2 style="text-align:center;color:darkslategrey">Bio</h2>
<p style="color:#F7D4D6">
I currently live in Far North Queensland with my wife and two young boys, having moved here from Northern Ireland in 2007. 

Although I have always had an interest in computers my previous career has been as a Chef.  After completing my apprenticeship in commercial cookery in Northern Ireland I worked in a diverse range of environments in Australia and New Zealand.  I am currently running a delivered meals service to elderly and disabled clients with an indigenous community advancement cooperative, which has proved to be a rewarding job and an excellent opportunity to give something back to the community. 

I have always had a passion for the outdoors, and have a particular interest in nature photography.  I have previously run a photography business in the Daintree Rainforest, where I lived in a completely off-grid home for around ten years. Until the launch of satellite NBN in 2015 the only mainstream communication option there was a landline telephone, which has given me a very sincere appreciation of the importance of access to reliable I.T. in the modern world.
